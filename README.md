# NightShiftTool

A (command line) tool for controlling Night Shift.

## Credits

-   [nshift](https://github.com/jenghis/nshift): NightShiftTool is basically a copycat of it, exercising the idea of pure Swift/SPM implementation of the same stuff, so that it could be installed via [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint).
-   [Shifty](https://github.com/thompsonate/Shifty):  If I knew it existed before, I would not start work on NightShiftTool at all, as I basically needed something to control night shift via hotkey or directly from the menu bar (was considering [SwiftBar](https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar) or the like, for automation)
